## [1.1.9] — 2026-05-21

Library expansion and a new in-UI request-paper workflow.  No kernel
API changes; user-visible additions are concentrated in the library
browser and the submission pathway.

### Added

- **"Request paper analysis" in the library browser.**  An empty-state
  toast appended to the bottom of the library list (also shown when a
  search yields no matches) opens a modal that takes an arXiv ID plus
  an optional reason / name / email.  Submitting relays the request
  through a Cloudflare Worker (`/request-paper`) and a GitHub Actions
  workflow that files a public issue on the SubTropica repository
  with the `paper-request` label.  Repeated submissions of the same
  arXiv ID within 24 h are deduplicated.
- **Spiering, Wilhelm, Zhang (arXiv:2406.15549) ingest** — 3 new
  library entries from two-loop intersection-theory examples.
- **Bargiela et al. (arXiv:2512.13794) ingest** — 79 new library
  entries covering a parametric two-loop family `I_{a,b,c}` (with
  starred variants).
- **`function_class: "higher_genus"` schema extension** for integrals
  whose period structure is a Riemann surface of genus g > 1.  Two
  optional companion fields: `genus` (positive integer) and
  `hyperelliptic_confirmed` (boolean).  Existing elliptic entries
  carry `genus: 1` automatically.
- **Marquee `PrimaryName` curation** for 7 newly-introduced frontier
  topologies.

### Changed

- **Inline LaTeX renders correctly in library titles and
  descriptions.**  146 topology / configuration titles and 79
  record descriptions had their embedded math (e.g. `I_{4,3,3}`,
  `M^2 - s_{12} - s_{23}`) wrapped with `$...$` so the UI typesets
  them via KaTeX.  Previously the same fragments were shown as
  raw LaTeX source.  Affected fields: `Name`, `PrimaryName`,
  `CanonicalName`, `Names[]`, and `Records[].description`.
- **`PrimaryName` now reaches the UI.**  The library.json builder
  was silently dropping `PrimaryName` on rollup; 327 curated names
  authored across previous releases had never been visible.  The
  aggregator now emits both `name` and `primaryName` per topology.
- **110 duplicate paper records auto-removed** across 72 entries
  (same `texkey`, identical or near-identical descriptions; the
  highest-quality record is kept).
- **19 new paper thumbnails** added.
- **Community submissions**: 3 results from PRs #30 and #33 on the
  public repo (`e12|e2|e|` and `e12|e3|e3|e|` two-loop one-mass
  families).

### Fixed

- **Spurious n=1 "Sunrise tadpole" topology removed.**  The entry at
  `111|e|:000|0|` was physically impossible (with one external leg,
  momentum conservation forces $p \to 0$, contradicting the cited
  $k_1^2 = M^2$).  The record (Zhang, arXiv:1612.02249, Exercise
  3.1) was describing the n=2 self-energy `e111|e|:1000|1|`; it
  has been migrated to the canonical entry, which now carries 9
  references.
- **Machine-generated audit text scrubbed from descriptions**: 158
  entries had inlined correction blocks and internal classifier
  tags pasted into `Records[].description`; the audit trail now
  lives in `Records[].structural.corrections[]`.

---

## [1.1.8] — 2026-04-27

UI and numerical-verification stability release.  Closes a systematic
30-case regression campaign over the live UI → kernel → backend path.

### Added

- **Per-call FIESTA `DataPath` isolation.**  `STNIntegrate[..., Method ->
  "FIESTA"]` now writes each call into its own scratch directory; back-to-back
  FIESTA verifications no longer trip on stale workspace artefacts.
- **`STVerify[..., MaxTime -> N]`.**  Per-call wall-clock cap, propagated to
  every backend's own time controls and to the outer `TimeConstrained`
  boundary.
- **Notebook output is no longer flooded by UI activity.**  `Print` / `Echo`
  emitted by request handlers (and by third-party numerical backends) is
  redirected to a per-session `kernel.log`; the JSON response file
  remains the single user-visible channel.

### Changed

- **Library "Load to editor" pre-fills the diagram name** with the per-config
  `CanonicalName` (e.g. *"double box, 1 mass"*), falling back to the
  topology-level name.
- **UI default LR algorithm is `Lungo`** in the Advanced panel; the old
  `Espresso` selection in the HTML disagreed with the JS default and could
  silently flip the active method on first interaction.
- **Export tab no longer emits `MethodLR` / `FindRoots` options when they
  match the current defaults** — only non-default options surface in the
  emitted `STIntegrate` command.
- **Library thumbnails: shorter external legs.**  Force-layout shrink applied
  to leg vertices in thumbnails so the diagram body dominates small previews.
- **UI multi-slot leg masses now emit kernel-canonical `M[v]` form**, matching
  `STCNickelToGraph`.  Single-slot legs still emit the bare symbol `M`.

### Fixed

- **`handleIntegrate` / verify IPC handlers surface the real exception** from
  the inner `STIntegrate` / `STVerify` call instead of a generic
  *"STIntegrate crashed"* / *"STVerify crashed"* string.  Errors like
  `STEspressoFubini::noorder`, `Symbolic::ivar`, and `STSymanzik::nodim`
  now reach the UI banner and the friendly-error classifier.
- **AMFlow result-shape and shared/massless-leg handling.**  AMFlow's IBP/DE
  output was being parsed in one shape on physical inputs and a different
  shape on shared-mass / massless-leg edge cases; both are now normalized
  before comparison against the analytic series.
- **`STToGinsh` `N[]` fallback no longer produces silently-wrong numbers.**
  The fallback path (used when ginsh isn't on `$Path`) skipped the
  `Sqrt[...]` unwrapping step, returning numerically incorrect values
  without any error.  The fallback now asserts the same prerequisites
  ginsh does and refuses to run if they don't hold.
- **`ConfigureSubTropica[<partial>]` no longer clobbers globals.**  Partial
  calls (e.g. `ConfigureSubTropica[PythonPath -> "..."]`) were resetting
  every unspecified global to its package default; the setter now writes
  only the arguments the caller passed.
- **Several UI shared-mass topologies (1-mass triangles, boxes) no longer
  return empty `SeriesData`.**  Two independent bugs were fused: the UI
  was emitting `Subscript[M, slot]` for multi-slot leg masses (kernel
  expected `M[v]`), tripping `stFindEuclideanRegion`'s head-based check
  and selecting a degenerate kinematic point; and the kernel-side
  memoization cache key ignored `MassConfig`, so a stale hit from a
  prior different-mass run shadowed the recomputation.  Both ends fixed;
  the misleading reason string *"shared-mass on-shell — unsupported"*
  is replaced by *"no Euclidean kinematic point found."*
- **UI ×MPL false-negative on diagrams that need rationalization.**  The
  "Check if MPL" button reported ×MPL on topologies whose Symanzik
  polynomial requires fibered rationalization first, even though a route
  to MPLs exists once `FindRoots` is enabled; the Tier-2 estimate now
  consults `FindRoots` state before issuing the verdict.


## [1.1.4] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **`STSubmitResult` from a notebook** no longer aborts with "no edges/nodes
  available." `stGateVerification` now reads the graph from
  `$integrationResult["uiResult"]` (populated by notebook `STIntegrate`) and
  falls back to `$integrationConfig` only for the UI/HTTP path.
- **`STSubmitResult` local dedup** now canonicalizes dedup-key fields before
  comparison. Previously `epsOrder` ("0" vs 0), `dimension` (`"4 - 2*eps"` vs
  `"4-2*eps"`), and `substitutions` (`""` vs `"{}"`) were compared with `===`
  and diverged on type or whitespace, causing spurious submissions of results
  already in `library-bundled/`.
- **`STNIntegrate[..., Method -> "FIESTA"]` with imaginary internal/external
  mass labels** no longer trips `Greater::nord` inside FIESTA's sector
  decomposition. Auto-detection of `ComplexMode` now uses
  `TrueQ[Positive[...]]`, which correctly returns `False` for
  `I*Sqrt[|Msq|]` entries coming from `stMakeVerificationPoint` in the
  Euclidean region.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-22

First public release of SubTropica — a Mathematica package for computing
Feynman integrals via tropical geometry.  The package automates the tropical
subtraction algorithm end-to-end: from a Feynman diagram (drawn in a GUI,
a graph topology, a propagator list, or a raw Euler integrand) to an analytic
expression in terms of hyperlogarithms, multiple polylogarithms, and MZVs.

Companion paper:
M. Giroux, S. Mizera, G. Salvatori, *SubTropica*,
[arXiv:2604.20954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.20954) [hep-th].

### Package at a glance

- **Core integrator.** `STIntegrate` is the single entry point for the
  full pipeline.  It accepts five input forms — interactive GUI, graph
  topology `{edges, nodes}`, propagator list, Mathematica-style `{x,a,b}`
  limits, and pre-built Euler quadruples `{pref, integrand, xvars, coeffs}`.
  Options cover dimension, ε-order, gauge fixing, heuristics, parallelism
  granularity, algebraic-letter handling, and post-processing.
- **Tropical subtraction engine.** Automatic Newton-polytope analysis,
  tropical subtraction scheme, singular subtractions, and ε-expansion for
  generic Euler integrals.  Handles logarithmic and power divergences;
  supports explicit and automatic Nilsson–Passare continuation for cases
  outside the geometric locus.
- **HyperIntica.** A native Mathematica reimplementation of
  [HyperInt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4361): hyperlogarithm integration
  with linear reducibility analysis, gauge scoring heuristics, parallel
  face-by-face integration, and an internal MZV lookup table.
- **Numerical backends.**  `STNIntegrate` and `STVerify` route to four
  independent backends — [pySecDec](https://github.com/gudrunhe/secdec),
  [FIESTA](https://bitbucket.org/feynmanIntegrals/fiesta),
  [AMFlow](https://gitlab.com/multiloop-pku/amflow) (FiniteFlow+LiteRed or
  FIRE+LiteRed), and [feyntrop](https://github.com/michibo/feyntrop) —
  for independent numerical verification of analytic results.
- **Finite-field pipeline.**  Optional
  [FiniteFlow](https://github.com/peraro/finiteflow) +
  [SPQR](https://github.com/Giu989/SPQR) backend for finite-field
  arithmetic on partial fractions, avoiding intermediate expression swell.
- **Interactive GUI.**  Browser-backed diagram editor launched by calling
  `STIntegrate[]` with no arguments — draw the graph, assign masses, set
  options, integrate, and inspect timings, kernel logs, and symbol output
  in tabbed panels.  The Export panel emits ready-to-paste `STIntegrate`
  commands in three input forms (graph, propagator list, Euler quadruple)
  and is fully client-side, so it renders in real time as you edit.
- **Non-blocking UI.**  `STBrowser[]` starts the local server and opens the
  UI in your default browser without spawning the native viewer, parallel
  kernels, or the main polling loop.  The evaluation cell returns
  immediately, letting you use the library browser, Review tool, and
  Export panel in parallel with other notebook work.  Use `STIntegrate[]`
  when you need the UI to call back into Mathematica for integration;
  `STStop[]` shuts everything down.
- **Companion library.**  A curated library of Feynman integrals ships
  with the package under `library-bundled/` (one directory per Nickel
  canonical topology × mass configuration).  The web front-end at
  [subtropi.ca](https://subtropi.ca) provides real-time topology matching
  against this library.  Current inventory:
  - **314** canonical topologies
  - **731** mass configurations
  - **178** computed symbolic results (all numerically verified against
    pySecDec or FIESTA where applicable)
  - **1,283** arXiv papers scanned for references

### Notation and conventions

- **Measure:** `dx / x` internal convention with explicit flattening at
  the user-facing API surface; see `docs/README.md` §2 for the full
  convention flow-chart.
- **Symanzik polynomials:** `U > 0`, `F ≤ 0` in the Euclidean region
  (both sign conventions supported internally); see
  [`notes/normalization.tex`](notes/normalization.tex) for the audit.
- **Algebraic letters:** `Wm[i]` / `Wp[i]` pairs carried as atoms in the
  returned series; explicit root substitutions available via
  `GetAlgebraicBackSubRules[]`.
- **Mass scales:** internal mass > external mass > Mandelstam, with a
  canonicalized symbol alphabet (`W_i` labels, trivial-1 drop, no
  compound `W` expressions).
- **Nickel index:** Mathematica-canonical first-appearance digit
  assignment throughout the library.

### Library & web companion

- 1,283 arXiv papers scanned via the extraction pipeline
  (`process_arxiv_papers` → validator → `extracted_to_library.wl`).
- Per-topology canonical names via `data/topology_names.json` (Tier-1 +
  compound chains + fallback).
- Per-diagram canonical names computed via the library-audit pipeline.
- Unphysical topologies (disconnected graphs, valence-≤ 2) quarantined
  under `library-quarantined/`.
- Submissions of new results: either push a PR to the public repo or use
  the Cloudflare Worker endpoint behind the `Submit` button in the web UI
  (auto-opens a curated GitHub PR).

### Numerical-verification toolchain

- **STVerify** — evaluates symbolic result at an auto-generated Euclidean
  kinematic point and compares against a numerical backend.  Detects
  non-Euclidean regions, handles shared on-shell/internal masses per
  backend, resolves the iε sheet via the `conjugate-fallback` pass, and
  auto-resolves delta-sign algebraic-letter ambiguities introduced by
  `FindRoots`.
- **Backends:** pySecDec + FIESTA + AMFlow (FF+LR or FIRE+LR) + feyntrop.
  Each is routed through its own compilation / IBP / sector-decomposition
  pipeline; STVerify forwards only user-supplied options to preserve
  backend-specific defaults.

### Installation

```mathematica
PacletInstall["https://subtropi.ca/SubTropica.paclet"]
Needs["SubTropica`"]
```

`ConfigureSubTropica[…]` persists tool paths (polymake, ginsh, pySecDec,
FIESTA, AMFlow/LiteRed/FIRE, feyntrop, FiniteFlow/SPQR, Maple+HyperInt)
in `$UserBaseDirectory`.  The package auto-detects tools on `$Path`, so
most users only set `PolymakePath` once.

### Requirements

- Mathematica 13.1+ (tested through 14.2)
- polymake ≥ 4.0 (required for Newton-polytope computations)
- Python ≥ 3.8 (required for the GUI and pySecDec driver)
- Optional: FiniteFlow, SPQR, pySecDec, FIESTA, AMFlow, feyntrop, ginsh,
  Maple + HyperInt — each enables a specific backend or convenience
  feature.  `STBenchmark[]` reports which dependencies are live.
