HyperD::usage = "HyperD[expr, var] computes the derivative of expr with respect to var,

Unlike the built-in D[], HyperD properly differentiates through Hlog and Mpl

Implements the standard formula for differentiating iterated integrals:

    - Differences of neighboring letters (wi - w_{i+1})

Uses the recursive structure of multiple polylogarithms:
  d/dvar Li_{n1,...,nk}(z1,...,zk)

Supports only positive integer indices. This is the core differentiation 
routine called by HyperD for Mpl terms.

Example:

  DiffMpl[{1, 2}, {x, y}, y] differentiates Li_{1,2}(x,y) w.r.t. y";


HyperSeries::usage = "HyperSeries[expr, {var, point, order}] computes the series expansion of expr around var = point up to O[var - point]^(order+1).

Handles expressions containing Hlog and Mpl by selecting a strategy for each factor:
  - Hlog with arg -> 0: ZeroExpansion.
  - Mpl with last arg -> 0: MplSum (defining partial sum, all depths).
  - Mpl with first arg -> 0: MplSum (outer sum vanishes, all depths).
  - Mpl of depth 1 (= PolyLog[n,z]): built-in Series via PolyLog.
  - Mpl of depth > 1 with last arg -> 1 and first arg fixed: returns unevaluated with a warning (log-series singularity; not yet implemented).
  - Otherwise: Taylor expansion via HyperD.

Unlike the built-in Series[], HyperSeries correctly expands through Hlog and Mpl in expressions where these functions appear with var-dependent arguments. Power::infy and Infinity::indet messages are suppressed internally.

Examples:
  HyperSeries[Mpl[{2}, {z}], {z, 0, 5}]

   We want to compute: \[Integral]_{0}^{var} poly(t) \[CenterDot] Hlog(t, word) dt
   where poly = parfr[[1]] is the polynomial part from partial fractions.
   
   -IBP:
   Let P(t) = \[Integral]_{0}^{t} poly(s) ds, so P'(t) = poly(t) and P(0) = 0.
   Let H(t) = Hlog(t, {Subscript[w, 1], Subscript[w, 2], ...})
   Then: \[Integral]_{0}^{var} P'(t)\[CenterDot]H(t) dt = [P(t)\[CenterDot]H(t)]|_{0}^{var} - \[Integral]_{0}^{var} P(t)\[CenterDot]H'(t) dt
   STEP a: Boundary term
       [P(t)\[CenterDot]H(t)]|_{0}^{var} = P(var)\[CenterDot]H(var) - P(0)\[CenterDot]H(0)
                        = P(var)\[CenterDot]Hlog(var, word) - 0
       \[RightArrow] Add P(var) to result[word]
       Note: The Hlog factor is implicit in the word index!
       result[word] accumulates the coefficient of Hlog(var, word).
   STEP b: Integration by parts correction term
       Using: d/dt Hlog(t; Subscript[w, 1],Subscript[w, 2], ...) = 1/(t - Subscript[w, 1]) \[CenterDot] Hlog(t; Subscript[w, 2], ...)
       The second term becomes:
       -\[Integral]_{0}^{var} P(t)/(t -Subscript[w, 1]) \[CenterDot] Hlog(t; Subscript[w, 2], ...) dt
       
       This is a NEW integral that must be processed!
       \[RightArrow] Append {-P/(var - Subscript[w, 1]), Rest[word]} to the queue
       
       The recursion continues until all polynomial parts are eliminated
       (leaving only simple poles, which are handled in the next step).

        If[n > 1, p = parfr[[i, n + 1]] / ((var - parfr[[i, 1]])^(n - 1) * (1 - n));

        {n, 1, m}], {i, 2, Length[parfr]}]];
  (*Comments:
   
   For each pole location a = parfr[[i,1]] with coefficients for powers 1,2,...,m
   
   CASE A: Higher-order poles (n > 1)
       \[Integral] c/(z-a)^n dz = c/((1-n)(z-a)^(n-1))
       
       This gives a rational function contribution to the primitive,
       plus an integration-by-parts term for the queue.
   
   CASE B: Simple poles (n = 1)
       
       \[Integral]_{0}^{z} c/(t-a) \[CenterDot] Hlog(t; Subscript[w, 2],...) dt = c \[CenterDot] Hlog(z; a, Subscript[w, 2],...)
       
       The pole location 'a' becomes a NEW LETTER prepended to the word.
       No integration by parts needed here; the integral is exact.
